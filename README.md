# 🧪 Diabetes Prediction Using Machine Learning

This project uses the **Pima Indians Diabetes dataset** to predict the likelihood of diabetes based on patient health metrics such as glucose level, BMI, age, insulin, and more.

Two models were implemented and compared:
- 🔹 Logistic Regression
- 🔸 Random Forest Classifier

## 📊 Project Features

- 📁 Data Exploration & Preprocessing
- 🧠 Machine Learning Models (Logistic Regression & Random Forest)
- 📈 Accuracy Evaluation and Confusion Matrices
- 📊 Bar Chart Model Comparison
- 📌 Medical Interpretation and Final Conclusion

## ✅ Results Summary

| Model               | Accuracy   |
|---------------------|------------|
| Logistic Regression | 76.62%     |
| Random Forest       | 72.09%     |

Since both models performed equally well, **Logistic Regression** is preferred due to its simplicity and interpretability.
